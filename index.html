  <p>Dear Mr./Ms. <b>{{lastName}}</b>, </p>
  <p>I appreciated the opportunity to meet with you yesterday about the
    position of Senior Sales Manager with Hubwiz.com. </p>
  <p>I really enjoyed meeting with members of the office and learning
    about the job. The entire team certainly seem to be highly skilled
    and motivated and the work itself seems as rewarding as it is challenging.
    From our discussion,I gained a strong sense of Hubwiz.com's commitment
    to their clients and their employees. I also enjoyed our discussion of my
    opportunities and future within the firm. </p>
  <p>I feel strongly that I possess the qualities required as a Senior Sales Manager.
    I believe my education and experiences have prepared me well for a future
    with you. I eagerly anticipate our next meeting. Thank you for considering
    me for this opportunity. </p>
  <p>Sincerely,</p>
  <p>Rose Jean</p>
